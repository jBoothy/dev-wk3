            I grew up in a couple different neighborhoods. The one I grew up in during my early years was a bit spooky. I grew up in West Valley, Utah which is a somewhat dangerous place. Even with that, I learned a lot of lessons about life and loyalty growing up in that environment.

            When I attending high school I moved to Springville, Utah where I became a Springville Red Devil. I lived in a quiet and cozy neighborhood that was polar opposite of my time in West Valley. Some of my favorite restaurants I would frequent were:
