  <h4>"This is the best and most attractive cohort I've ever seen" -Kyle Baugh</h4>
  <p>  I, Scott Sutherland, want to let it be known that this is single handedly the greatest cohort I have ever
      seen in all my years with Devmountain. Don't believe me? Just ask the others: "I agree with Scott," Kyle
      Baugh exclaimed "that this is the best and most attractive cohort I've ever seen!" I also interviewed
      Joely Vernier and she said "By far the smartest and best cohort that's ever come through Devmountain." Well there you
        have it folks. Not one, not two, but three instructors have said it and there's no way someone else
        could write this for me. If you'd like to sign up for our hourly news letter just put in your name and email
